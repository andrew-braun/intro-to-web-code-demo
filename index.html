							I'm totally a person! You know that saying that "on the internet
							no one knows you're a dog?" Well, I certainly don't have to worry
							about anyone finding out I'm a dog because I'm 100% human. Yep.
							That's me. Don't even
							<i>start</i> with offering me belly rubs and treats!
						</p>
						<p>
							Leave me alone. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Excuse me. A bolt
							of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's
							ever gonna strike. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.
						</p>
						<p>
							C'mon, c'mon. Um, well it's a delorean, right? It's already
							mutated into human form, shoot it. Just finishing up the second
							coat now. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you
							two.
						</p>

						<p>
							What? Excuse me. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey
							see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Hey, hey, I've
							seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is
							where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Alright, we're the
							pinheads.
